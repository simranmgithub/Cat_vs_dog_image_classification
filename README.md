## Acknowledgements

 Introduction:

This project aims to classify the input image as either a dog or a cat image. The image input which you give to the system will be analyzed and the predicted result will be given as output. Machine learning algorithm [Convolutional Neural Networks] is used to classify the image. The model thus implemented can be extended to a mobile device or any website as per the developer’s need.

Conceptual Framework:

The project is entirely implemented using Python3. The Conceptual Framework involved is mainly:

      Keras – Tensorflow backend
      OpenCV – Used to handle image operations



## step 1:

The dataset is available in the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats
Download the dataset and store it in local dist


## step 2 :
Installing Required Packages 
1. OpenCV     [ Used to handle image operations like : reading the image , resizing , reshaping]
2. TensorFlow   [ Tensorflow is the backend for Keras ]
3. Keras  [ Keras is used to implement the CNN ]
4. Dense,Conv2D,MaxPool2D,Flatten
## step 3: Working
The dataset contains a lot of images of cats and dogs. The aim of this model is to make the model learn the distinguishing features between the cat and dog. Once the model has learned, i.e once the model got trained, it will be able to classify the input image as either cat or a dog.
## Tools Used:
 Google colab

 
## Application:

This project gives a general idea of how image classification can be done efficiently. The scope of the project can be extended to the various industries where there is a huge scope for automation, by just altering the dataset which is relevant to the problem.
